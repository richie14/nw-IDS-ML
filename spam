My previous 2 years of work experience as Cyber Security Analyst at TCS, India has given me exposure of this field and work done in India. My motive to take part in the the programme is staying touch with the real life industrials challenges faced and build network with people in this industry that would benefit me during and after my graduation.

There are abundant opportunities to advance and grow in the field of cyber security. I love taking up new challanges everyday and cybersecurity work can be extremely challenging and it is a new adventure.Cybersecurity incidents can negatively impact every aspect of our lives. Many cybersecurity professionals see their work as highly important, in the same way a doctor or teacher would hopefully view their work.

After graduation, I aspire to work as a Cyber Security Engineer in the Cyber Security Industry. Performing assessments and penetration testing, development and implementation of secure network solutions or architecting and engineering trusted systems into secure systems.
